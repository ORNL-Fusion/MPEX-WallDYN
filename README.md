# MPEX-WallDYN
WallDYN3D workflow

This is a repository for the MPEX-Digital-Twin workflow. It contains scripts for the integrated material migration code (WallDYN3D) to simulate the transport and deposition of plasma particles onto surfaces. Particle transfer matrices needed by WallDYN3D come from solps-gitr.
